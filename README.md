# Dig Dug
Digging holes is a must for any kid. Especially those who are on the hunt for buried treasure. This game is about just that, finding buried treasure. How much treasure
can you find? Dig through the level to increase your score. But watch out for the bad guys who are trying to stop you!

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
